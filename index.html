<p>I&rsquo;m finally here.
I mostly post on <a href="https://john.colagioia.net/blog">my blog</a> on various topics (programming, Free Culture, <em>Star Trek</em>, social justice issues, media, and whatever else I feel like talking about), and have been investigating alternatives to a (ahem) certain social media website currently owned by a cartoon supervillain.
I&rsquo;ll try to at <em>least</em> post here to announce blog posts, and will interact depending on how well I integrate into the broader community.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Excellent analysis, and it goes with something that I&rsquo;ve been screaming about forever, which is that you can&rsquo;t make anything &ldquo;apolitical.&rdquo;  Every work of art, every craft project, every industrial product, and everything in between relies on a set of assumptions and intentions, which have a history and which have a center of gravity in politics.  You can choose to interrogate them as you work and present what you want, <em>or</em> you can deliberately remain ignorant of them and let someone who you&rsquo;ve never met choose your politics for you.  And one of those seems like an extremely odd choice&hellip;</p>

<p>This episode is highly illustrative of the &ldquo;real life&rdquo; from my title, where everybody is charmed by the guy who says racist and sexist things, and also lean <em>hard</em> into their microaggressions to ignore a colleague&rsquo;s pleas for help and ultimately his danger.  The walk-on character, though, speaks up about some of it, telling us that the <em>characters</em> hold these views, not necessarily the writers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found myself thinking a lot about why <strong>Star Trek:  Picard</strong> (and a lot of modern <em>Star Trek</em>) feels so&hellip;empty, and a few other people posting about it convinced me that I should air my thoughts somewhere other than the newsletter adjunct to my blog.  And word of warning, it got a <em>little</em> out of control.</p>

<h2 id="quick-background">Quick Background</h2>

<p>While I didn&rsquo;t grow up watching <em>Star Trek</em>, I caught the occasional rerun of the original or animated series, and saw something different in it.  I put more effort into watching, when <strong>The Next Generation</strong> aired, because while I considered it watchable, the show definitely lacked something, and <strong>Deep Space Nine</strong> filled that something.  Then, I gave up on <strong>Voyager</strong> early on, and skipped <strong>Enterprise</strong>, until watching both streaming a few years ago.</p>

<h3 id="first-generation">First Generation</h3>

<p>I disagree with the people&mdash;fans, creators, and even characters&mdash;who claim that <em>Star Trek</em> offers us utopia, even in the beginning.  The early episodes use Janice Rand specifically to show us that they haven&rsquo;t fixed sexism.  McCoy says outright misogynist and racist things as &ldquo;his thing.&rdquo;  Scott looks up to fascists, wants a war, and has an entire episode about his misogyny.  Spock doesn&rsquo;t <em>call</em> Vulcan culture &ldquo;toxic masculinity,&rdquo; but his attacks on Rand and Uhura, occasionally bemoaning that he can&rsquo;t express what people mean to him, and the weird survival rituals make the intent fairly clear.  Kirk even talks about how the <em>Enterprise</em>&rsquo;s mission centers on proving to everyone, including themselves, that Starfleet has a viable vision for the future, and talks about how we need to commit <em>every day</em> to not doing violence to each other.  And any utopian aspect comes from their working for a better future, but they haven&rsquo;t gotten there.</p>

<h3 id="next-generation">Next Generation</h3>

<p><strong>The Next Generation</strong> changed things a bit.  While fairly apparent that they cribbed a lot from the abandoned <strong>Phase II</strong>, the Federation has apparently changed a lot.  Picard treats almost every culture as an enemy and will tell anybody who&rsquo;ll listen about how humanity has become flawless.  It takes <em>years</em> before anybody cares that Data has no civil liberties, effectively a slave to Starfleet, who they insist has no emotions, despite all evidence to the contrary.  LaForge finds out that doctors could have given him natural eyes.  But none of them want to <em>fix</em> anything, except the occasional mourning of the passing of communal dinners.  In fact, Wesley has several episodes where the plot wants to tell us that, sometimes, overt bigotry actually makes the best policy.</p>

<p>And <em>I don&rsquo;t know</em> if the writers meant this as satire, and I&rsquo;ve underestimated their skill, because the show never &ldquo;winks&rdquo; at us, even as (for example) Picard mounts an attack on a government facility, because of a conspiracy theory that certain leaders have succumbed to some foreign influence, or we start looking for characters in Federation labor camps.  We could see this as exposing the silliness of the right-wing movements building in the West and United States in particular.  Or we could see it as an embrace of it.  Instead of debating this (and I wish that more people would), fans tend to dismiss the early episodes as poorly structured, blame the later problems on Ron Moore, and&hellip;still tell us how much they love the show, even though I can&rsquo;t find much left.</p>

<p>(I <em>suspect</em> that they might have intended the change, though, because <strong>The Final Frontier</strong> and <strong>The Undiscovered Country</strong> hint at a right-wing shift in the culture.  The former tells us about a religious figure rallying poor folks, to unleash a force that could destroy the Federation, which sounds fairly offensive.  Then, with the collapse of the Klingon Empire in sight, the latter shows us a massive conspiracy to keep international hostilities alive.)</p>

<p>Anyway, <strong>Deep Space Nine</strong> absolutely wants us to know that the Federation has huge problems, and that people need to force their governments to do better by people.  <strong>Voyager</strong> punted on those questions, but the fact that they had an &ldquo;at least we&rsquo;re not <em>literal</em> fascists, like them&rdquo; episode says a lot; pro-tip, if your show needs an episode like that, then it probably won&rsquo;t help.  And&hellip;<strong>Enterprise</strong> didn&rsquo;t stick with me at all, and I doubt that I could name more than two characters or episodes.</p>

<h3 id="third-generation">Third Generation</h3>

<p>That brings us to today.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery</strong> launched and made me hopeful &mdash; it has the only pilot in the franchise that anybody would consider watching for its entertainment value, and the Klingon &ldquo;basket of deplorables&rdquo; (for lack of a better term) story had the <strong>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</strong> feel of the original series, talking about &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; while not-so-secretly talking about us &mdash; but Paramount seemed to decide that they could tamp down the disgusting backlash around the existence of certain actors by punting on the Klingon story.  And it has scrambled to try to find its niche, since, occasionally trying to say something (like that organized crime only exists when government fails to serve people), but those occasional messages get muddled and buried, and they felt the need to (for all intents and purposes) remove the series from any sensible form of continuity to feel <em>that</em> confident.</p>

<p>Despite my defending it, though, <strong>Discovery</strong> also makes some bizarre decisions, like making the franchise&rsquo;s first transgender character, effectively, the <em>imaginary friend</em> of its first non-binary character.  And I still don&rsquo;t understand Tilly&rsquo;s deal.  Does she (poorly, I presume) represent some subset of neurodivergent folks in some coded way, or does she look more like how the studio views its fans, technically capable, but clumsy and wanting everyone to center her?  (I still boggle at the time that she reveals that she &ldquo;secretly&rdquo; wants to become a captain, someday.  Do cadets <em>not</em> sign up hoping for promotions?)</p>

<p>And where <strong>Discovery</strong> stumbles, the other shows&hellip;sit on the floor petulantly, so that they don&rsquo;t need to worry about stumbling.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think of <strong>Lower Decks</strong> as the most straightforward disappointment, a comedy about the lower-level crew on a ship tasked with &ldquo;second contact&rdquo; missions.  On paper, it sounds ideal for satire, ideal for showing how things look to the people who don&rsquo;t have power, and ideal for showing how superficially and ethnocentrically the franchise treats encountering new cultures.  Instead?  It reifies those problems, and has nothing to say about them, other than that the writers find it funny.  Instead of skewering the anti-Semitic characterization of the Ferengi or the ableist depiction of the Pakled, they laugh at the <em>characters</em> from those backgrounds, for not having our wonderful advancement.  Does the shady organization pillaging ancient cultural sites lead into a story about artifact repatriation?  No, we find out that Picard funds it, so&hellip;it must be good, QED?  They find corruption in Starfleet and laugh it off, instead of legitimately asking why almost everybody with a rank of Captain or higher, who doesn&rsquo;t headline a show, either died to motivate the plot or had some plan to build themselves dictatorial kingdoms for well over a hundred years.</p>

<p><strong>Strange New Worlds</strong> also boldly refuses to go anywhere, in its own special way.  They obviously want to reboot the original series with a <strong>Next Generation</strong> aesthetic.  But they also lecture us with &ldquo;morals&rdquo; like how our refusal to compromise with fascists will cause World War III, we need to respect religions even when they support genocide, institutional bigotry doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as you can pass, and risk means warmongering.</p>

<p>Incidentally, we knew basically <em>one thing</em> about Pike from <em>The Cage</em>, that he felt burned out and had a strong urge to sink into fantasy worlds, whether daydreams about (ugh) the slave trade or the Talosian illusions.  How does any production team write an entire series around that episode and not give him an addictive personality?  That would make so much more sense than the idea that he watched <em>The Menagerie</em> on space-Paramount+ and doesn&rsquo;t like the wheelchair.</p>

<p>Oh, <strong>Prodigy</strong>?  I consider it slightly better than the rest, after the first few episodes, but it still had the nerve to build up the idea that the Federation has severe laws against Augments, then&hellip;makes an exception for the one who we coincidentally got to know&hellip;again.  Why advocate for political change, when exceptions will make most people nearly as comfortable with the status quo, right?  Janeway certainly hasn&rsquo;t needed to navigate commanding a member of her crew with no civil liberties, after a&hellip;sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t even get through typing that without laughing derisively.</p>

<h2 id="get-to-the-point">Get to the Point</h2>

<p><strong>Picard</strong>, though, disappoints in an entirely different direction.  They kicked off the series with two extraordinary crises, an influx of desperate Romulan refugees and the genocide of &ldquo;synthetics,&rdquo; androids and holograms.  Patrick Stewart has become a pretty good guy, and we had a diverse crew, so this had a lot of promise.  And yet&hellip;</p>

<p>The show doesn&rsquo;t have anything to say about the refugees, bizarrely.  Picard employs a bunch of them, doing manual labor around his <strong>ancestral castle</strong> (tell me again, Jean-Luc, how nobody in the Federation cares about money, and people only work to improve themselves&hellip;), and his attraction to one of those vulnerable employees poses a serious problem, in that&hellip;he&hellip;doesn&rsquo;t know how to express romantic feelings?  What now?  And the literal mass murder of synthetics only spurs Picard to miss a dead friend who they remind him of, setting off on a galactic adventure to make exactly zero political change or even complain about the deaths, but finding a place where synthetics can hide and isolate themselves from the Federation.  Does he mourn his friend?  No, he does not.  Does he work to make sure that the Federation won&rsquo;t kill more synthetics?  No.  Does he say that, maybe, he bears some responsibility, because he didn&rsquo;t defend Data aggressively enough to the Federation?  Certainly not.  Picard doesn&rsquo;t need to grow or learn, because he had an adventure.  He even <em>died</em>, which has had impressively little effect on the series or even his life.</p>

<p>By the way, does the Federation or the public know about Picard&rsquo;s new body?  Given that they killed off all those &ldquo;synthetics&rdquo; as collective punishment for a minor terrorist attack, doesn&rsquo;t his new status put him in extraordinary danger?  Maybe they carved out an exception for him, like Dal gets to serve as Starfleet&rsquo;s pet Augment.</p>

<p>In the second season, we have another &ldquo;look, at least we&rsquo;re not <em>literal</em> fascists&rdquo; episode &mdash; apparently forgetting that the Federation planned the genocide of multiple enemy civilizations, when they showed that the &ldquo;Confederation&rdquo; exterminated some cultures &mdash;  which sends them on a timeline-spanning adventure where Picard, again, substitutes action scenes for emotional growth.  They don&rsquo;t even bother with a metaphor, this time out, because Picard literally needs to confront the trauma of his family past, by going to the specific places linked to that trauma, and remember repressed memories to fix the timeline and his family history.  Why?  Oh, Q set the entire thing up, so that Picard could learn to&hellip;ask his refugee employee out, I think.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve now seen a few episodes of the third and final season, in which we have an improbable conspiracy spanning multiple civilizations to run (alleged) terrorist campaigns.  But the show doesn&rsquo;t really care about that.  The season uses this as a pretext to put Picard back in touch with his old colleagues, seemingly now substituting a galaxy-spanning adventure for calling his friends.</p>

<p>By the way, despite the show&rsquo;s attempts to convince us otherwise, Captain Shaw seems like a perfect fit for this era.  He hates the Borg, which the writers want to offend us, but again, the <em>Enterprise</em> crew built an entire system to kill all Borg in the galaxy, which would have included Seven of Nine, and the Federation recently &ldquo;dismantled&rdquo; an entire variety of life.  Shaw also has an interesting line that seems like it should have carried more weight, though:  When operating outside Federation space, he tells us, the captain must prioritize the <em>safety of the crew</em> above all else.  In other words, the Prime Directive seems gone, and &ldquo;safety of the crew&rdquo; could even justify all sorts of atrocities.  Exploration and peace-making seem abandoned, too.  Instead, Starfleet takes care of its own&hellip;unless you come from a background that people don&rsquo;t like.  That sounds about right, and I don&rsquo;t think that the show really disagrees with him, except in that they like Jeri Ryan.</p>

<p>I call this show especially disappointing, because unlike <strong>Lower Decks</strong>, where I assume that the writers click the &ldquo;random page&rdquo; button on Memory Alpha six or seven times to decide on the major plot beats (try it and tell me that another process better explains the show&hellip;), I can see excellent stories that <strong>Picard</strong> could have told us, instead.  I would love to watch a show where Picard has an emotional breakdown watching the news, goes to therapy like an adult, and reaches out to his friends and family to rebuild those relationships and mourn their losses.  He might give some thought to his unfortunate views in past decades, and try to advocate for better; if we must have the contrived fatherhood subplot, maybe even add some introspection about why neither mother nor child called to tell him.  And, hey, if that happens to <em>lead</em> to adventures across space and time, then what can you do, right?</p>

<p>Anyway, don&rsquo;t act like Picard, kids.  Deal with your problems.  Call your friends, even if they won&rsquo;t call you.  Stand up for vulnerable people, instead of &ldquo;letting&rdquo; them labor at your company.</p>

<p>Note that I&rsquo;ll take back a lot of what I said, if this current conspiracy plot turns out to subvert the terrorism trope, and they actually expose a broad coalition of Changelings, Romulan refugees, surviving synthetics, and Borg, who want to demand equal rights under Federation law, and Picard and the rest of the former <em>Enterprise</em> crew uses their clout to help them.  I <em>doubt</em> that we&rsquo;ll get it, but it&rsquo;d at least try to put the franchise on the right path and try to tie the series up into something vaguely coherent.</p>

<p>Oh, and one final thought:  Except for unceremoniously clearing <strong>Picard</strong>&rsquo;s decks to make room for <strong>The Next Generation</strong>&rsquo;s cast, the franchise has recently done a solid job with casting and giving us decent to good characters played by spectacular actors.  I want these shows to do better, so that we can see Sonequa Martin-Green, Michelle Hurd, and Babs Olusanmokun, for example, do something that people will still remember in a few decades, before the franchise over-extends itself and crashes again.</p>

<p>Accustomed as I&rsquo;ve become to writing blog posts, this clocks in at around three thousand words&hellip;<em>after</em> chopping out some bits that didn&rsquo;t seem to go anywhere.  And if you don&rsquo;t care about <em>Star Trek</em>, apologies in advance.</p>

<p>I want to preface this post by saying that, especially because <strong>Star Trek:  Picard</strong> traded largely on nostalgia, don&rsquo;t take any of my attempts at analysis as telling you not to enjoy it.  I didn&rsquo;t enjoy the show, but I also don&rsquo;t fit modern <em>Star Trek</em>&rsquo;s demographic of &ldquo;nostalgic for the 1990s.&rdquo;  While I watched it as it aired, I never loved <strong>TNG</strong> like a lot of people did, and as I rewatch it for <a href="https://john.colagioia.net/blog/tag/startrek">my Thursday blog posts</a> to try to figure out how people actually live in the Federation, I don&rsquo;t see that it has improved with age.  If you love both shows, I have no objection to that.</p>

<hr />

<p>Since I <a href="https://cohost.org/jcolag/post/1135997-complaining-about-mo">posted before about <strong>Picard</strong></a> &mdash; and modern <em>Star Trek</em> in general &mdash; I&rsquo;ll briefly recap my views on the first two seasons.  And then I&rsquo;ll dig into the third season in some detail, assuming that readers have also watched or don&rsquo;t care.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Starts out by promising us a political thriller that would end in sweeping change, drifts through a weird story about a robot god that never comes together, and ends with Picard kinda-sorta learning that he shouldn&rsquo;t push people away.  <details>&lt;summary&gt;Also, &lt;/summary&gt;Picard dies.</details></li>
  <li>Starts out by telling us that the problem with dating your refugee employee begins and ends with your emotional problems, not the power differential inherent in employment or her refugee status.  Somehow becomes an action-adventure therapy session for Picard, so that Q can heap praise on the former captain.  <details>&lt;summary&gt;Also, &lt;/summary&gt;the Borg retroactively become good guys, letting Allison Pill do some actual acting for a couple of episodes before shuffling her off to her next gig where she&rsquo;ll undoubtedly play yet another nerdy, socially awkward sidekick character. 🤷</details></li>
</ol>

<p>That brings us to the third season.</p>

<p>If you want a summary in the same style, I&rsquo;d go with something like this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starts out by promising us another political thriller that would end in sweeping change, becomes a buddy movie, and ultimately mostly wants you to know that it watched all the films to prepare for this.  <details>&lt;summary&gt;Also, &lt;/summary&gt;the Federation has nothing wrong with it, so please stop asking why the good guys keep planning genocide.</details></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really bothers me, though, that the season has some questionable politics that it would rather not talk about.</p>

<h2 id="tngs-final-frontier">TNG&rsquo;s Final Frontier</h2>

<p>In my blogging about life in the Federation, one post changed how I think about <em>Star Trek</em>:  <a href="https://john.colagioia.net/blog/2022/04/14/tff.html"><strong>The Final Frontier</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Specifically, scrape away the comedic bits, the bits that they definitely intended to come off as comedic even though nobody laughs, and the awkward self-serious philosophizing, and you have a story about how some older folks (the crew) need to bash in the heads of some poor people, because an &ldquo;outside agitator&rdquo; (secretly Spock&rsquo;s half-brother) turns them into peaceniks by letting them (gasp!) talk about their feelings in a safe space.</p>

<p>Sure, Sybok ends up fronting for the cult to the most depressing god in the galaxy, but nobody knew that when the <em>Enterprise</em>-A flew in to intervene with the aforementioned skull-busting.  Starfleet sent Kirk to deal with the uppity poor folks.  In the time that it took the main cast to plan vacations to Yosemite during the refit in <strong>The Voyage Home</strong>, the main cast has gone from telling Starfleet where it can stick its regulations so that it can go back in time to save Earth by joining environmental conservationists, to planning to shoot poor people who have convinced some minor diplomats to join their sit-ins.</p>

<p>We ignore the intrusive fascist turn, though, because they <em>want</em> you to read the movie as a story about friendship.  Don&rsquo;t worry, though.  The intrusive fascist turn becomes the subject of <strong>The Undiscovered Country</strong>, in fact, when not-Chernobyl ends not-the-Cold War and a bunch of chicken-hawks stage assassinations to keep their jobs.  The movies seem to <em>want</em> to tell a story about the Federation&rsquo;s moral decline.</p>

<p>How does this relate to <strong>Picard</strong>?  Well, it turns out that our main plot secretly involves a bunch of older folks (the <em>Enterprise</em>-D crew) needing to bash in the heads of some young people, because outside agitators turn them into communists.  Seriously, communists.  In the &rsquo;90s, we all looked at the Borg and said, &ldquo;oh, how racists think about Chinese people,&rdquo; an inscrutable enemy that throws bodies at military problems, doesn&rsquo;t care about Intellectual Property, and lives communally, sharing everything in squalid conditions.</p>

<p>Both stories have our aged crew coming back for &ldquo;one last adventure,&rdquo; that happens to look a lot like a fight to protect a not-so-great status quo against social progress.</p>

<h3 id="insecure-borg">Insecure Borg</h3>

<p>The change in villain to the Borg, in my eyes, made <em>no</em> sense, for both straightforward and subtle reasons.</p>

<p>Most straightforward &mdash; and <em>everybody</em> has already picked up on this &mdash; the show ended the previous season, which they filmed back-to-back with this season, by reforming the Borg retroactively.  The Borg had a new queen who saw Picard as a surrogate father, and they provisionally joined the Federation.  Did that not happen?  Did they massively oversell the change and Jurati only controlled a tiny commune?  Do they not have a stake in a Borg invasion of their new allies?</p>

<p>Worse, though, their plan strikes me as simultaneously so brilliant as to have given them the option to quietly skip this entire season to succeed without opposition, so absurd as to let a handful of senior citizens stop and undo their plan over a weekend, and redundant enough that I wonder if they got drunk before setting everything into motion.</p>

<p>I mean, the Borg spent &mdash; presumably &mdash; years getting the super-Changelings to infiltrate Starfleet, compromising the security of the transporters, and turning a significant fraction of the Federation&rsquo;s population into bio-Borg.  The transporters don&rsquo;t Borg-ify adults, but one imagines that the Borg organs (Borgans?) don&rsquo;t randomly explode on the subject&rsquo;s twenty-fifth birthday.  And the Queen mentions that this will let Borg reproduce instead of assimilate.</p>

<p>And then&hellip;wait.  Why doesn&rsquo;t this state constitute victory for them, exactly?</p>

<p>I ask, because they opt to&hellip;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Steal Picard&rsquo;s corpse, which they already had, because otherwise how did they put Picard&rsquo;s DNA in the transporter programming?</li>
  <li>Turn Starfleet into the Death Star™.</li>
  <li>Attack Earth.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, they draw attention to themselves, when they could have hibernated for a couple of decades or traveled to the future and had control over everyone in Starfleet, every diplomat to pass through the Federation, most of their families, and the entire scientific community.  From there, it would take maybe a week to convince the overwhelming majority of people to Borg-ify themselves, and they&rsquo;d have assimilated the <em>entire Federation</em> and probably other cultures, with little to no actual effort.  Instead, they take that perfect plan and drill a huge, Picard-shaped hole in it, apparently only so that our protagonist can foil their plot.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ll get to this from a different angle later, but if the Borg control all the young people on every Starfleet vessel, who cares that Starfleet networked its ships to act as a single unit?  The Borg already <em>do</em> that.</p>

<h2 id="a-changeling-of-direction">A Changeling of Direction</h2>

<p>What the heck did Vadic and her crew have to do with <em>any</em> of this?</p>

<p>They spend eight episodes beating us over the head with Vadic&rsquo;s similarity to Khan and General Chang.  She monologues about how the Federation has mistreated her and her people.  And then they kill her and&hellip;none of that matters.  We pretty much forget about them, once someone says the word &ldquo;Borg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I also have no understanding of the Changeling plan in all this.  They steal Picard&rsquo;s corpse&mdash;which, again, they must have already had and used&mdash;from a facility that they&hellip;control?  But they also steal the portal-gun, so that they can commit some random murder, even though killing young people works against the main plot, and they already had that weapon, I think they mentioned in dialogue.</p>

<p>Plus, in the final bickering, we find out that the Borg made &ldquo;a deal&rdquo; with Vadic, to make all this happen.  But&hellip;what deal?  What could they have gotten out of this mess?  In some ways, it almost sounds like the Borg Queen sent Vadic a check to collect Jack Crusher, and everything else happened incidentally, but that makes even less sense.</p>

<h2 id="we-wont-need-this-anymore">We Won&rsquo;t Need This Anymore&hellip;</h2>

<p>Personal preference, but I hate the wasted guest stars.  Why haul in fan-favorite characters, for them to only deliver some exposition before killing them off?</p>

<p>It especially makes no sense, at least to me, to bring back Ro Laren for this.  The episode gives Michelle Forbes some time to show that she can act circles around the rest of the cast.  It gives her an enormous backstory that sounds like they should have given us a series about her, instead.  She hands off her work to Picard.  And then&hellip;💥 she go boom.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-hell-seriously-federation">What the Hell, Seriously, Federation?</h2>

<p>Maybe I have a cynical streak, but in my aforementioned blog posts, I often see the Federation as a fairly dark place, full of macho posturing, racism, and extreme pressure on children to succeed.  As I&rsquo;ve written before, Picard lectures us about how the Federation doesn&rsquo;t care about wealth and power, but he grew up in his ancestral castle that marks the centerpiece of a successful winery &ldquo;now&rdquo; employing large numbers of refugee laborers, so&hellip;I don&rsquo;t trust him any more than I trust any wealthy person today to tell me how poor people live.</p>

<p>Even with that grounded view, though, this season of <strong>Picard</strong> makes the Federation look <em>bleak</em>.</p>

<p>Vadic drops the bomb that the Federation genuinely intended genocide against the Changelings, and they only survived to the degree that they did, because some Changeling&mdash;presumably Odo, though she doesn&rsquo;t drop anybody&rsquo;s name, there&mdash;infiltrated Section 31 to steal the cure.  And&hellip;nobody cares about the accusation of a literal war crime, because I guess that they don&rsquo;t mind some genocide as long as it happens to an enemy or two.</p>

<p>Vadic also drops the bomb that Federation scientists forced them to participate as subjects in medical experiments, planning to enslave them as super-spies, to explain their greater fidelity at shape-shifting.  And again, this seems like a fairly big accusation, that everybody shrugs off as a normal thing that scientists do.</p>

<p>Oh, and I forgot that Riker made an offhand reference, somewhere along the way, to &ldquo;lifting the ban on synthetics.&rdquo;  I keep pointing out, because the franchise seems to want to forget, that this series technically started in <strong>Short Treks</strong>, <em>Children of Mars</em>, showing the attack by &ldquo;rogue synths&rdquo; on Mars.  This led to the Federation disassembling and banning all synthetic lifeforms, which if it happened to characters that we cared about, we&rsquo;d call&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;genocide.  Riker&rsquo;s passing comment about &ldquo;lifting the ban&rdquo; feels like another attempt to show that nobody cares about fairly bad behavior.  Sure, they engaged in genocide as a form of collective punishment a few years ago, but the &ldquo;ban&rdquo; ended a few months ago, so anybody who managed to hide for fifteen years can come home.  Perfectly fine&hellip;</p>

<p>And&hellip;OK, does Starfleet have, like, <em>one guy</em> working in a basement, who has a personal mission of turning all of Starfleet into a network of self-driving cars?  I imagine that he finally gets his way, spends a few months hiding in a supply closet while an enemy predictably takes over the fleet and uses it to destroy the Federation&rsquo;s defenses, and then crawls back to his desk to submit a new copy of his memo suggesting that they automate the fleet.  I have to imagine this, because in six months, <strong>three</strong> season finales for <em>Star Trek</em> shows have featured this exact plot point.</p>

<ul>
  <li>October 27, 2022:  <strong>Lower Decks</strong> (2381) introduces the automated and networked <em>Texas</em>-class ships, that turn out to have an evil AI that inexplicably has nothing to do with the other evil AIs in the series, because that show doesn&rsquo;t even try to make sense.</li>
  <li>December 22, 2022:  <strong>Prodigy</strong> (2384) has the <em>Protostar</em>&rsquo;s evil AI infect the now-networked Starfleet, which turns on itself.</li>
  <li>April 13, 2023:  <strong>Picard</strong> (2401) introduces the totally original idea that Starfleet has decided to network all their ships, so that they can act as one, which the Borg quickly exploit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I realize that self-driving cars haven&rsquo;t lived up to the hype, but this seems like an extreme phobia manifesting.</p>

<p>By the way, regardless of the idea&rsquo;s originality or degree to which they mean to create an allegory for a real-world threat, what purposes can this new technology serve?  I can only think of exactly what the Borg did with it, creating an off-brand Death Star.</p>

<p>Finally, we should talk a bit about the epilogue.  In it, we learn&hellip;</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Federation continues to quietly cover up major crimes, as long as the perpetrator saves Earth from an attack.</li>
  <li>They have automated stop-and-frisk, because decades after the end of the Dominion War, they still prefer a police state and arresting every member of a minority group to potentially making friends with a shape-shifter or Borg.</li>
  <li>Everybody (except Data) thinks of therapy as a joke, where talking about your feelings frustrates the therapist who has important vacation-planning to do.  The franchise has always hated therapy, from making Troi completely useless in <strong>TNG</strong> and Sybok&rsquo;s evil &ldquo;talk about your pain to become a zombie&rdquo; weirdness in the aforementioned <strong>The Final Frontier</strong>, so I don&rsquo;t know why this surprised me, except that <em>our</em> world&rsquo;s views have changed substantially on the topic.</li>
  <li>Picard assures Jack that, no, nepotism has nothing to do with his assignment.  But also, they renamed a ship in his honor and assigned all his friends to the bridge, so much like dude-living-in-a-castle lecturing us on the insignificance of money, maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t trust him on matters of corruption?</li>
</ul>

<p>They play it as the happiest of endings, but it feels like <em>such</em> a downer.</p>

<h2 id="pandering">Pandering</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have much more to vent about, but I do want to mention that it comes close to infuriating me to see what a liberal hand <strong>Picard</strong> has with the <em>Star Trek</em> fanfare (&ldquo;doo-de-doooo&hellip;&rdquo; and so forth), to the point that it feels more like the substitute for a laugh track than a music cue.  &ldquo;We did a thing that you nerds will recognize.  Get hyped,&rdquo; it seems to shout.</p>

<p>Granted, not many people will find this as important, but it seems especially strange after Michael Giacchino made such a big, public deal after writing the music for the 2009 reboot film, that he wanted to hold off on playing the fanfare until the moment when he thought that the story had earned it.  By contrast, <strong>Picard</strong> uses it as punctuation.</p>

<p>And then we have the constant stream of Easter eggs pounding at us from behind the screen.  I know that some people love this stuff, but it often felt to me like reading a Wikipedia article about <em>Star Trek</em> than watching <em>Star Trek</em>.</p>

<h2 id="if-only">If Only&hellip;</h2>

<p>As a bit of lighter humor for anybody who scrolled down this far (anybody who <em>read</em> all this, I don&rsquo;t know how I can help you&hellip;), I want to propose some <em>Star Trek</em> shows that I would rather have watched than <strong>Picard</strong>.  I&rsquo;ve mentioned a few of these elsewhere, and I assume that some lack originality, so I apologize if any seem familiar.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sisko</strong>:  Let&rsquo;s start with the elephant in the room.  If they had built this series around Avery Brooks, he wouldn&rsquo;t have let it stop filming with any whitewashing of genocide or other unethical behavior.  He also wouldn&rsquo;t have wasted time wondering if he should try to sleep with his employee.</li>
  <li><strong>Ro</strong>:  Like I said above, they seemed to bring in Michelle Forbes to show off her overwhelmingly superior acting chops and give her the most interesting back-story of anyone in the series.  I&rsquo;d rather watch three seasons of that, if they can&rsquo;t convince Avery Brooks to come back.</li>
  <li><strong>Phase II and a Half</strong>:  OK, I joke about the title, but <strong>The Animated Series</strong> and the original cast films created a bunch of characters that they hung out to dry, never to return to them.  I say take M&rsquo;Ress, Arex, a revived Will Decker, a revived Ilia, a revived David Marcus, Saavik, the injured kid who Scotty hauls up to the bridge instead of sickbay, and so forth, recast them, and give them their own ship.  Though, admittedly, I&rsquo;d rather watch that than the exhausting <strong>Strange New Worlds</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>My Kingdom for a Sargh</strong>:  You remember, &ldquo;you have not experienced Shakespeare, until you have read him in the original Klingon&rdquo;?  I want the story about the old Klingon scout ship that crashes into Elizabethan countryside, and the survivors try to blend in by forming a theater troupe, each week combining a Klingon classic play with a continental European inspiration.  Meanwhile, all the period writers that conspiracy theorists claim &ldquo;really&rdquo; wrote Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays form a secret society intending to murder the Klingons, so the season finale ends with bat&rsquo;leth fight.</li>
  <li><strong>Cleanup on the Twentieth Century</strong>:  Given how careless crews seem to act around time travel, I want the story of the team with a dedicated time-ship that follows up on each of these missions, quietly fixing the messes that the other crews made.</li>
  <li><strong>No Justice, No Peace</strong>:  Since <strong>DS9</strong>, <em>Star Trek</em> has shown us a Federation that has planned genocide against at least three cultures&mdash;the Borg, the Changelings, and the Synthetics&mdash;imprisonment and persecution of Augments that goes back centuries, and we see that Romulan refugees largely act as migrant laborers to survive.  I want the show where the various disadvantaged groups band together to demand equal rights under Federation law.  I half-hoped that the final season of <strong>Picard</strong> might turn into that, but it has no interest in engaging with politics, other than casting change as something to prevent with violence.  The attack on Mars presumably had a point to it, after all.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Part of me wants to see if I can figure out how to make <strong>My Kingdom for a Sargh</strong> work without the <em>Star Trek</em> trappings&hellip;)</p>

<p>Honestly, though, I mostly only want a return to the time before <em>Star Trek</em> considered itself &ldquo;comfort food&rdquo; or &ldquo;a love letter to&rdquo; itself.  Make us question our role in society&rsquo;s problems, like all enduring science fiction does.</p>

<p>It takes a bit of technical knowledge and a place to put it, but <a href="https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback">Tweetback</a> will take the Twitter archive that you downloaded when you decided to stop trusting Twitter - you <strong>did</strong> download it, right&hellip;? - into a nice little website that is aware of the other archives, once they&rsquo;ve registered with the listed project.</p>

<p>I made some changes to mine - I ripped out the short URLs and replaced them with the real destinations, fixed the search to work on GitHub Pages (sure, relying on another free offering from a big corporation), and messed around with the styles - but feel free check out <a href="https://jcolag.github.io/twitter/">my Twitter archive</a> to get a sense of what it looks like.  Down at the bottom of the front page, you&rsquo;ll also notice that it includes statistics (like showing that I used my account to yell at a certain prior US President).</p>

<p>For this episode, we talk about racism, bad leadership, and the continued refusal to plan ahead.</p>

<p>Extra editorializing for Cohost:  This episode strikes me as interesting, because the characters are <em>horrible</em>, but the performances light up the screen, particularly Picard blustering about how treaties shouldn&rsquo;t matter, instead of reading the thing, then acting smug when he can tell the aliens off.  On Picard, it looks petty and unintelligent.  On Patrick Stewart, it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t usually comment on things when I share them, but <em>seriously</em>:  While any time makes a great opportunity to cut back on corporate-produced entertainment and spend at least the remaining amount on indie artists (to atone for your <em>Star Wars</em> habit or whatever you have), today makes an especially good time to do that.</p>

<p>Partly, because doing so will help diversify the media available to us, so that we don&rsquo;t have half a dozen companies with overlapping shareholders controlling every industry.  But also because I think it would look hilarious if things got so bad for the studios that Disney had to sell Indiana Jones on eBay or Discovery/Warner had to find a different parking lot management company to sell DC to, since Kinney no longer exists.</p>

<p>Shockingly, it&rsquo;s both more and substantially less nuanced than this.</p>

<p>Whatever you want to call these systems, they&rsquo;re what AI people call &ldquo;neural networks&rdquo; under the covers, where you have a bunch of teeny programs (or program-like thingies) that act like your high school biology class taught you:  Aggregate a bunch of inputs and, if the total exceeds a threshold, send output.</p>

<p>If you have enough of these, you can do fancy things that look like they&rsquo;re on the path to biomimicry, like detecting objects in an image or performing tasks that we usually oversimplify as &ldquo;broom-balancing.&rdquo;  For an example of the latter, consider backing up an eighteen-wheeler, where you need to keep compensating for where the trailer might go.  There&rsquo;s a lot of potential in those spaces to make a lot of processes safer or just more efficient.</p>

<p>Starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo">AlphaGo</a>, though, we started to see a weird shift in the industry.  With the resources to have orders of magnitude more &ldquo;neurons&rdquo; than I could play with when farting around with neural networks in the 1990s, instead of making better things that neural networks are good at, they started trying to train them to act like people.  And here&rsquo;s where it gets kind of funny, in my eyes:  We use neural networks for <em>the dumbest possible things</em>, wasting computer time by having the neurons kinda-sorta figure out what we already knew how to do in the 1960s.</p>

<p>That is, when they rigged up AlphaGo to show how it was managing its model of the game state, it was just a plain tree, where you figure out the likeliest score based on each possible move, exactly how every chess AI has worked since the 1970s.  That should have been an important result in a <em>different</em> way, because everybody was sure that you couldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;solve Go&rdquo; using classical AI algorithms.</p>

<p>Instead of that impressive outcome, though, people started setting neural networks to solving <em>other</em> solved problems, so now we have an entire generation of software that pretends to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov process</a>.  Is it nicer than the code that I wrote in the 1990s?  Sure, because it doesn&rsquo;t always work word-by-word, and it doesn&rsquo;t even need to work with words at all.  But that&rsquo;s not an artifact of the neural network; we could do that in ordinary code, if we wanted to, and it would burn far fewer CPU cycles than simulating billions of neurons to give you the wrong answer.</p>

<p>And because we apparently have an entire industry that doesn&rsquo;t see this, we have all the Big-Five tech companies (and others) racing to see who can have the biggest neural network (maybe compensating for something, after the Billionaire Space Race flopped) and <em>lose money</em> as they spend significantly more on electricity than any subscription fees that they collect&hellip;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Good question!  I don&rsquo;t know that this answer will end up as <em>useful</em> to anybody, whatever that might mean for a particular person, but in broad strokes, I&rsquo;d call myself a fan.</p>

<p>Because I started my career writing C, I make my comparisons from there, and Rust looks a lot like what I wish C had grown into - especially the memory model - instead of always reifying old ideas of what makes &ldquo;good&rdquo; code and leaving the future to someone else.  I contrast that assessment with how I feel about Go, which seems like a decent enough language, but feels so much like a response to specifically-1980s academic criticisms of C (&ldquo;you can read declarations aloud, left-to-right,&rdquo; for instance) that it feels like the language came out thirty years too late.</p>

<p>More to the point, for my personal projects, the few projects that (had I worked on them fifteen years ago) I would have written in C, I now reach for Rust.  I still don&rsquo;t know it well enough to write it off the cuff like I do with languages that I use or have used every day.  But a couple of years back, I wrote the back-end of a local search engine (local, as in &ldquo;for specific files on my computer, like notes&rdquo;) in Rust, and it only took about a thousand lines and a few hours to handle the indexing, searching, and network code to spin up a server.</p>

<p>I wish that Rust had a more complete object model and would ditch the macros, but I can mostly understand why they made those choices.</p>

<p>My only &ldquo;real&rdquo; objection probably involves the culture around it, but I feel that way about most languages.  Because Rust basically gets ignored in all contexts but &ldquo;read this list of some languages that we&rsquo;ll call up-and-coming&rdquo; clickbait, many Rust developers seem to want to find opportunities to &ldquo;convert&rdquo; people, and that doesn&rsquo;t help.  I mean, they don&rsquo;t come off as bad as Python people (no offense to Python people, but wow, I sometimes feel like, even if I only write about starting a project in notes to myself that I won&rsquo;t ever publish, someone will still show up to ask if I&rsquo;ve considered using Python for that&hellip;), and I get that the alternative of writing enormous projects in Rust takes far more effort than commenting online, but it still feels a bit embarrassing.</p>

<p>For this episode, we talk about parenting, civil rights, and why the Federation would care so much about studying a new android.</p>

<p>This episode feels ahead of its time in the <em>worst</em> ways of the franchise, predicting the bleakness of the modern shows where we find out that people do have huge problems - like how various parts of the population don&rsquo;t have the right to parent their own children, because the Federation wants to &ldquo;study&rdquo; them - but the writers contrive a way to sidestep the issue, so that we now know that &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; has horrible policies but nobody cares enough to actually fight those policies except maybe (eventually) to the extent that it affects someone they care about.</p>

<p>For this episode, we need to talk about precarious colonies, android rights, ill-defined emotions, trying to make patients cry, and more.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, the story that dares to ask whether anger and frustration qualify as emotions and how far you can push someone before they commit murder&hellip;and then shrugs and walks away before letting anybody answer.</p>

<p>When I <em>almost</em> responded to a colleague, this morning, that of the many conflicting things that another company had told us on a call, that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all true, <em>especially</em> the lies,&rdquo; my role suddenly came into focus.</p>

<p>Mysterious past?  Taking an interest in unconventional younger colleagues?  Lunchtime-adjacent meetings?  Literary discussions, off-book projects, maintaining covert information channels?  Sense of someone sending me into exile?  Wide range of unrelated-seeming skills, most of which have a weird story about a time that I had to work with someone halfway around the world under ill-defined but tense circumstances?  Yes, yep, uh-huh, check, and mm-hmm.</p>

<p>I appear to have become&hellip;<strong>the Office Garak</strong>.  I guess that I finally need to get that sewing machine working again to complete the transformation.  And word of warning?  If you can&rsquo;t spot the Garak in your office&hellip;it&rsquo;s probably <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>I <em>believe</em> that I learned about the project from people talking about it here, so thanks to the people mentioning it enough for me to notice the licensing!</p>

<p>A one-week update on my exploration of Indie Web technologies and some gesturing at where I may go next.</p>

<p>Since people seemed interested last week, have a quick summary of where things stand.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The work that I did last week definitely allows me to receive Webmentions (with some caveats, and with the use of a second third-party server) on my statically-generated blog.</li>
  <li>This post sends (myself) a Webmention, with the results probably knowable when you read this but not when I write it.</li>
  <li>The IndieAuth thing that I set up last time won&rsquo;t work for the Microsub protocol, so I&rsquo;ll need to weigh that.</li>
  <li>Assuming that sending a Webmention works, then I&rsquo;ll need a browser extension to tell me which sites can receive them, so I started work on <a href="https://github.com/jcolag/earburn">Earburn</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ah, the wonderful episode where our heroic lead, ignoring that her policies reflect his policies, triumphs in the episode by badgering the elderly woman until she has an emotional outburst.  And once again, they structure the episode <em>so</em> well that you can&rsquo;t reasonably deny that they meant you to interpret it that way, even though they definitely don&rsquo;t want us to ask what happened to Tarses&hellip;</p>

Like I Come up with Better Names&hellip;</h1>

<p></p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m the last person hearing about this, but meandering through my library&rsquo;s website turned up an interesting find.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gnooks.com/">Gnooks</a>, a <a href="https://www.gnod.com/">Gnod</a> project, asks for three authors that you like, and then recommends other authors, giving you the opportunity to refine the search with an I-already-know-them-and&hellip;yes/no.  I grabbed Nnedi Okorafor, Casey McQuiston, and Amal El-Mohtar<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5970946:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as a trial run, and it suggested Nghi Vo, P. Djèlí Clark, Alix E. Harrow, all solid recommendations if I didn&rsquo;t already know their work.  It only gave me one author who I&rsquo;d call a &ldquo;hard pass.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5970946:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.  More importantly, it tossed in T. Kingfisher, Caitlin Starling, and Silvia Moreno-Garcia for me to investigate later, never heard of any of them, before I decided not to spend too much time on the one task.</p>

<p>It looks like Gnod also does art, movies, and&hellip;wait, <em>search engines</em>?</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

      <p>A few years ago, I realized that all my favorite authors looked suspiciously like middle-aged white guys<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5970946:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, so I started taking advantage of the Libby app and assorted history/heritage months to expand my horizons.

      <p>I won&rsquo;t name them, because people get (probably not unreasonably) emotional about the person&rsquo;s work, but they (only) don&rsquo;t do anything for me.

<p></p>

<p>As we near the end of <strong>Star Trek:  Discovery</strong>, and since they&rsquo;ve built this season as a sequel to <strong>TNG</strong>&rsquo;s <em>The Chase</em> - along with plenty of <strong>TNG</strong> name-dropping, lest you think that even one show in the modern franchise has any criticisms of decisions made in 1987 - I want to state my demands on how to resolve this plot point, finally paying off the most important comment in <strong>TNG</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all we know, this might just be a recipe for <em>biscuits</em>&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like the idea of the <em>Discovery</em> crew deciphering an ancient biscuit recipe, staring at it absolutely baffled, and making peace with the Breen over a massive breakfast spread.  At this point, it also seems fitting given Paramount&rsquo;s apparent financial trouble, if took a page from Gene Roddenberry&rsquo;s book and marketed Progenitor Biscuits™ with Kwejian Gravy™ everywhere they could to turn a couple of extra bucks.</p>

<p></p>

<p>(OK, but for all the people halving the name to call the ship <em>Disco</em>, why not use the entire name and make it <em>very disco</em>, and drop a mirrored ball&hellip;?)</p>

<p>Since I wrote something <a href="https://cohost.org/jcolag/post/1381365-a-whole-mess-of-pica">wrapping up <strong>Picard</strong></a> when it ended, it felt reasonable to do something similar for <strong>Star Trek:  Discovery</strong>, a show that I actually mostly enjoyed.  Unlike the rest of this &ldquo;third generation&rdquo; of the franchise, <strong>Discovery</strong> always seemed to want to break the mold and actually explore new (conceptual) space, even if it didn&rsquo;t always get there.  Or as I describe it in my snarkier moments, the only show (OK, along with <strong>Prodigy</strong>) in the modern franchise not trying to constantly convince me that I&rsquo;d feel better watching <strong>TNG</strong> instead.</p>

<p>No, really.</p>

<hr />

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the franchise as it stands.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I won&rsquo;t discuss <strong>Discovery</strong> in this one line, since the entire post will talk about it&hellip;</li>
  <li><strong>Picard</strong> occasionally tried to do other things, but it always reverted to posing as the thirty-third through thirty-fifth seasons of <strong>TNG</strong>, especially ending as it does with an explicit &ldquo;get the gang back together, because nothing else matters&rdquo; final season.</li>
  <li><strong>Lower Decks</strong>, through its design, choice of plots, and overall approach to storytelling all but openly worships <strong>TNG</strong>, refusing to criticize anything that the earlier show did, beyond &ldquo;did you laugh at that?&rdquo;  It&rsquo;ll mention, reference, and homage other shows, but usually as &ldquo;the <strong>DS9</strong> episode&rdquo; or equivalent.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6270438:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Prodigy</strong> felt aimless early on, but found a plot that it mostly stuck to until the season finale when they told us that none of it really mattered&hellip;but maybe it&rsquo;ll figure out what to do now that they&rsquo;ve cancelled and resurrected it.</li>
  <li><strong>Strange New Worlds</strong> started out as backdoor pilots on <strong>Discovery</strong> where Pike made a weirdly big deal about feeling persecuted for his religion (despite the lack of evidence of such), then went on to have episodes with heavy-handed morals about how we need to compromise more with fascists to prevent fascist insurrections, respect religions that want everybody to die, not to mention that you need to oppress people or else they might gain power in the government and stop the oppression.  Along the way, it seems to have the thesis that the original series should embarrass us with its progressive messaging, and that <em>Star Trek</em> only truly works when you model the crew as a patriarchal family, and I can&rsquo;t see it as anything but a plea to reboot the original series with <strong>TNG</strong>&rsquo;s aesthetic, and none of those pesky stories about how we stop killing each other only by deciding not to kill when presented with the option.</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, let&rsquo;s quickly review how <strong>Discovery</strong> tried to do things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Season 1 starts out using the Klingons as a metaphor for a certain &ldquo;basket of deplorables.&rdquo;  Because <em>Star Trek</em> has always had some of the worst fans, they backed off on that and dumped the crew into the Mirror Universe, followed by the aftermath of a war, lest we forget to blame Burnham for (double-checking my notes&hellip;) doing exactly the right thing in the pilot, and only failing because they stopped her.</li>
  <li>Season 2 backdoors <strong>Strange New Worlds</strong> while also assuring angry fans that, no, don&rsquo;t worry, <strong>Discovery</strong> will never have any impact on the parts of the franchise that anybody cares about.</li>
  <li>Season 3 changes its mind every couple of episodes about what it wants to do with its distant future, especially with The Burn™, which <em>could&rsquo;ve</em> sensibly resulted from <strong>Discovery</strong>&rsquo;s impromptu trip to the future (not noticing the similarity between Burn and Burnham seems implausible), or the fallout from that <strong>TNG</strong> episode telling us that warp drive would eventually destroy subspace, or almost anything else, but instead we got a child throwing tantrums, I guess because Doug Jones wanted more screen time.</li>
  <li>Season 4 did a much better job of holding things together, largely tried to get a two-part episode to make sense stretched across thirteen episodes.</li>
  <li>Season 5 finally succumbs to <strong>TNG</strong>-fealty by making an entire season&rsquo;s worth of sequel to <em>The Chase</em>, and had a lot of fun with the concept, but&hellip;well, I wrote this post for that.</li>
</ul>

<p>I go through all this to make the point that <strong>Discovery</strong> always felt like a huge outlier in the franchise, both in its ambitions and in its seeming inability to achieve those ambitions for whatever reason.</p>

<h2 id="about-that-fifth-season">About that Fifth Season&hellip;</h2>

<p>Your opinions might differ, and I have no problem with that.  However, I saw two huge problems with this final season.  But at this point, I feel like anybody still watching the show does so for the solid performances, not anything like a consistent plot structure.</p>

<p>In any case, we have the first problem of the goofiest cluster of antagonists that I&rsquo;ve ever seen in this franchise.  OK, <em>maybe</em> they come in ahead of Sybok&rsquo;s cult in <strong>The Final Frontier</strong> that, ignoring the &ldquo;evil god&rdquo; part that literally nobody knew about ahead of time, looks suspiciously like a bunch of poor people coming together for mutual support after their governments abandoned them.  But the Breen started out as blank slates, and&hellip;continue to look a lot like blank slates.  And L&rsquo;ak and Moll&hellip;I mean, seriously, &ldquo;moll&rdquo; comes right out of 1930s slang for a woman (often stereotyped as a sex worker) who spends time around gangsters.  In other words, everything about the season&rsquo;s &ldquo;villains&rdquo; feels like placeholders that they forgot to revise, <em>and</em> none of them really have any effect on the story, never learning anything that Burnham doesn&rsquo;t, and never forcing anybody on <em>Discovery</em> to reconsider their assumptions.</p>

<p>The other problem arises from the fact that we all could&rsquo;ve guessed the ending based on the fact that the macguffin-tech serves no legitimate purpose.  <em>Star Trek</em> has never had a population collapse for the characters to worry about.  Their distant future barely has the capacity to forge alliances with old friends, let alone start a massive campaign of colonization.  Nobody seems threatened with extinction unless they can evolve into their new environment.  Other than keeping the technology out of everyone&rsquo;s hands, then, going on the scavenger hunt makes no sense.</p>

<h2 id="not-all-bad">Not All Bad</h2>

<p>That said, they did some fun things (and some inane things) with the scavenger hunt.  But I wish that we had gotten a more intense puzzle with more steps and less of the surly teen (played by someone who should have aged out of that role a long time ago) obsessed with her older rebel boyfriend.</p>

<p>Likewise, introducing Rayner as the worst kind of <em>Star Trek</em> fan delighted me, from his forcing his way into scenes to grump about the show &ldquo;wasting&rdquo; time on Burnham and Book&rsquo;s relationship beats to complaining that we haven&rsquo;t gotten to the pew-pew-pew part of the episode, and might (gasp) solve a problem with diplomacy.  And rehabilitating him mostly felt credible, with so many characters sharing the load of telling him off.</p>

<p>The season <em>also</em> finally figured out how to not waste Mary Wiseman.  Previous seasons have inappropriately modeled Tilly on a stereotypical <em>Star Trek</em> fan, the smart-but-awkward kid who thinks that their knowledge of the franchise will help them succeed in life.  I mean, they literally introduced her as <em>secretly</em> wanting to eventually become a captain, calling into question why you would ever join an organization like Starfleet if not to get promoted to more interesting positions.  But this season, they ditch all that awful affect, and make her someone who leads through compassion, which makes a lot more sense for Wiseman&rsquo;s acting range.</p>

<p>Add in some modern Federation politics and intrigue (often camouflaged as Saru having relationship issues), something that the other shows seem <em>terrified</em> to think about lest someone not see their version of the Federation as anything but utopian, and they could&rsquo;ve had some great television to close out the series.</p>

<h2 id="literally-last-but-not-least">Literally Last but Not Least&hellip;</h2>

<p>In a lot of ways, the finale had a strong chance to fix the problems.  Instead, it&hellip;</p>

<p>It&hellip;</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know what that final episode tried to do.</p>

<p>We spent <em>way</em> too much time smacking around the aforementioned surly teen and pretending that she had anything to contribute to the story.  We blow past the inevitable revelation - as the season did by not pointing out its absurdity - that no, creating life doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can resurrect the dead, something that anybody who as ever encountered a pregnant person or other animal could&rsquo;ve told you.</p>

<p>We also spent far too much time on a battle that ended - as the season should&rsquo;ve begun - with everybody agreeing to skip the Breen nonsense and move on.</p>

<p>And the resolution <em>makes no sense</em>.  Yes, I called it inevitable before, because nobody has any legitimate use for the technology.  But they know that it presents a danger, and decide to leave it to fate, because Burnham decided that the galaxy has enough diversity in it, which feel like something that the franchise doesn&rsquo;t want to teach.  I could&rsquo;ve imagined a Prime Directive argument, where creating a new species would absolutely constitute interfering with its development.  I could&rsquo;ve imagined a political argument calling for its destruction, because Kovich and Section 31 can <em>absolutely</em> piece together everything that they need to know to capture the technology and use it against the Federation&rsquo;s perceived enemies.  But &ldquo;nah, man, we have plenty of diversity&rdquo; feels like the worst outcome.</p>

<p>And what the heck happened with Nhan?  She helps to save the day, because she - Saru&rsquo;s words, not mine - considers <em>Discovery</em> family, and then takes a nap during the big reunion scene?</p>

<p>The epilogue, though?  It would&rsquo;ve made me much happier to fast-forward through the conclusion so that we could spend more time seeing how Sonequa Martin-Green would look if the make-up team accentuated her resemblance to Nichelle Nichols in her later years, and maybe give us some other futures.  If we spent less time with space-battles, maybe we could&rsquo;ve given the recurring cast some closure and a future, since we so rarely check in with them other to verify that they still exist&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="errjust-one-more-thing-maam">Err&hellip;Just One More Thing, Ma&rsquo;am.</h2>

<p>(Insert Peter Falk impression here.)</p>

<p>Why does Admiral Burnham ditch <em>Discovery</em> at a specific position to wait for Craft?</p>

<p>It probably doesn&rsquo;t matter, but it seems to me that no character would know (or care, for that matter) about what happened in a fourteen-minute short from six years ago, taking place a thousand years in the future.  Stranger, we already knew most of Zora&rsquo;s side of that background from that <strong>Short Treks</strong> episode, but this does nothing to enlighten us about how Craft would&rsquo;ve gotten there.</p>

<p>It does <em>raise</em> the new question of why the Federation would care enough about Craft to explain it, especially given Paramount&rsquo;s financial situation definitely not suggestive of an impending series starring Aldis Hodge.</p>

<h2 id="anyway">Anyway&hellip;</h2>

<p>Regardless of my quibbling, I&rsquo;ll miss <strong>Discovery</strong> in a way that I haven&rsquo;t missed and won&rsquo;t miss the rest of the modern shows.  I could&rsquo;ve done with a lot more of this show consistently stumbling than the disinterested polish of last-man-standing <strong>Strange New Worlds</strong>&hellip;</p>

<p>For this episode, we need to talk about paranoia, logic obsessions, self-entitlement, racialized careers, and more.</p>

<p>This episode (and its part-two, that I&rsquo;ll talk about, next week) supply a funny anachronistic feeling, because decades later, the minor guest stars look significantly more important than the guest stars that they built the episode around.  Like, sure, Leonard Nimoy and Mark Lenard spark joy, but Malachi Throne, Erick Avari, and Stephen Root all swing by as if different decades&rsquo; audiences wouldn&rsquo;t pick them out of a lineup first, no matter how many prosthetics they have on.  And sure, they did that with Ashley Judd recently, too, but she only needed to overshadow a sulking teenager&hellip;</p>

<p>Most people who&rsquo;ll read this already know it, but for the people &ldquo;sitting in the cheap seats,&rdquo; if you think that you&rsquo;ve fixed your racism/sexism/transphobia/other bigotry because the less-privileged folks in your circle don&rsquo;t have any complaints, this is why.  People don&rsquo;t complain because <strong>they don&rsquo;t trust you</strong> to not retaliate in a society that will favor you over them, not because they don&rsquo;t have complaints.</p>

<p>This goes for everything from how you treat people to why the statistics on, say, sexual assault don&rsquo;t reflect what you see.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re afraid of confrontation or live in fear of crossing the line where you&rsquo;ve turned the bad guy into the victim so that you get banned, there&rsquo;s an ancient, time-tested solution to those problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We don&rsquo;t [do the problematic behavior] around here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Find the version that feels comfortable coming out of your fingers.</p>

<p>And you do this for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, think of this as the interpersonal version of calling fascists &ldquo;weird.&rdquo;  &ldquo;You, over there, are the outlier, who somehow can&rsquo;t figure out our customs.  You are <em>not</em> speaking for some silenced and oppressed majority.&rdquo;  Note that you&rsquo;re not telling them that they&rsquo;re wrong or arguing harm (though they deserve it), just explaining that this community doesn&rsquo;t work that way.  But also, it speaks to the &ldquo;folks in the cheap seats,&rdquo; particularly the (pardon the stereotype) thirteen-year-old white boy who thinks that &ldquo;edginess&rdquo; will make him friends, and needs to hear that, no, friends <em>respect</em> people and watch out for each other.</p>

<p>As a bonus, it works in person, too, though you can also replace it with the &ldquo;narrow your eyes dismissively&rdquo; stare&hellip;</p>

<p>It feels so on-the-nose that <strong>nobody</strong> in this episode cares about what Worf might actually want.  They experiment on him.  They write him off as a lost cause.  They berate him for feeling bound to a cultural tradition.  But nobody sits him down to point out that he does almost all of his warrior-ing from behind a fancy desk or asks what matters to him.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame, but making money in social media is&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to say &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; but it reminds me a lot of the old joke about publishing in almost any niche, that the way to get a million dollars is to spend <em>two</em> million dollars.  There&rsquo;s a reason that every successful service only finds itself torn between &ldquo;we keep the Nazis around to keep you engaged with the ads&rdquo; and &ldquo;what if we sell all the user content to AI farms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where to find me elsewhere, for the people who want to do that and I hope do?  I try to keep links up to date on <a href="https://john.colagioia.net/">my website</a>, and my blog lives there, so hang onto that if it&rsquo;ll take you a while to settle in.  But at the moment, I&rsquo;m quiet but reply to people at a few other places.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mastodon.social/@jcolag/">Mastodon</a> is the next-most-likely place that I&rsquo;ll post something off my blog.  I realize that it&rsquo;s not a popular opinion, but I trust the overall Fediverse to stick around permanently, even if every server has its weirdness.  I have other Mastodon accounts that came with accounts on other systems, so if you can&rsquo;t or would rather not connect to the &ldquo;flagship server,&rdquo; ask and I&rsquo;ll point you somewhere else.</li>
  <li><a href="https://nota.404.mn/people/e4313920967a0136074b076893c08a76">Diaspora</a> doesn&rsquo;t connect to the Mastodon/Pleroma/Pixelfed/etc. cluster, but has a similar setup.</li>
  <li><a href="https://spoutible.com/jcolag">Spoutible</a> might survive, if only because it&rsquo;s the owner&rsquo;s showcase for their bot-detection system.  I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;ve had any actual conversations, there, though.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcolag">LinkedIn</a>, I guess.  Or you could search Facebook or X (maybe Instagram, too?  I forget) to find me, if you must, even though I don&rsquo;t post to any of them or visit often.  However, I do have <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> installed and connected to all three accounts, so if someone wanted to message me there, I&rsquo;ll probably see it.</li>
  <li>I signed up on <a href="https://pinkary.com/@jcolag">Pinkary</a> late last week, and it seems&hellip;fine?  Quiet, and mostly people talking about PHP, which makes sense since the creator is deep in the Laravel project.</li>
  <li>I won&rsquo;t post them here, because it seems unlikely, but if you&rsquo;re more of a chat person, I also have Matrix, XMPP, and Discord accounts that I use to various extents, roughly in that order.</li>
</ul>

<p>And I&rsquo;ll be around for, what, the next three weeks?</p>

<p>I also have a public e-mail address on the blog, and those of you who I follow can see a less-public address in my profile, if you&rsquo;d rather go that route.  If we don&rsquo;t interact much or if your name doesn&rsquo;t match what you go by here, though, please do me a favor and give me some context&hellip;</p>

<p>And if you posted a similar list and I <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> tracked you down when you believe that I would have, it&rsquo;s probably my lack of organization and how rarely I check in on most sites, not any personal beef, so please reach out. 🫡</p>

<p>Otherwise, thanks to @staff for providing the place, and those of you who have made the place worth being for somebody.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t bother to mention it in the post, but because of the guest, I ended up reading the production section in Wikipedia&rsquo;s article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier"><strong>Frasier</strong></a>, and I&rsquo;ve never read so many red flags at once.  Worries about concept similarities to decades-old sitcoms, changing settings because the original setting passed LGBT protections, deciding that the therapist should come from English instead of Latin America, and more.

<p></p>

<p>The length comes from the likelihood of most people reading not having <em>any</em> idea of where this conversation comes from.</p>

<h2 id="apologies-first">Apologies, First</h2>

<p>I apologize for getting to this so late.  I&rsquo;ve had a lot going on, and didn&rsquo;t want to treat this dismissively.  But also, the delay feels awful, given how few people (<strong>hint, hint</strong>, people) ask me anything&hellip;</p>

<p>The answer simplifies to&hellip;not much, other than me updating library versions when GitHub asks me to.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>For those people who haven&rsquo;t done deep dives into my blog or GitHub profile, presumably almost everybody who sees this, I launched the <a href="https://github.com/jcolag/Bicker">Bicker</a> project twice.  If you know this or don&rsquo;t care and only want a straight answer, as hinted at the top, feel free to skip to the end.</p>

<p>The original version came about fifteen or so years ago, when I worked with some people on a project, and we got tired of using and searching through e-mail.  I came up with the idea of presenting communications in a way that kept people focused on the conversation itself, as opposed to only reacting.  I had a few ideas, here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can&rsquo;t reply to the entire message, only at punctuation marks, because that forces people to actually read the message to figure out what they want to riff on or object to.</li>
  <li>Reverse the visual threading, so that replies take up more width than the post that they reply to, since an ongoing conversation means paying attention to recent directions more than the original context.</li>
  <li>Adding different kinds of replies, mandatory icons to summarize your reply.  I don&rsquo;t know if I ever did so, but because they provided a good set to work with, I planned to adapt the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement_hand_signals">hand signals used by the Occupy movement</a>.  Either way, this helped defuse some conflict arising over tone, since you needed to indicate that you wrote in support, as a tangent, to suggest an alternative, or whatever.</li>
  <li>While no longer exciting, it also relied heavily on supposedly exciting-at-the-time (even though it worked almost ten years prior) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a> to show where people currently had their attention, under the assumption that you might avoid piling on, if you see many people already typing their responses to a problem-point.</li>
  <li>Because <em>I</em> liked (and still like) e-mail, and because this would allow submitting comments throughout a text at once, I don&rsquo;t know if I implemented it, but I at least wrote code to accept incoming e-mail and figure out how to add a response based on where you inserted your comment(s), and could send updates when your comments got a response.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I intended this for teams, I didn&rsquo;t think about moderation beyond this, other than the usual administrative moves of warning a user to stop privately, locking them out of their accounts, and deleting their replies.</p>

<p>My team used it for a while, though fell apart soon after.  I ended up selling the software to a handful of companies as &ldquo;appliances,&rdquo; pre-installed on small computers that they could plug in and shove in a cabinet, and no, I don&rsquo;t know why any companies wanted me to buy their hardware for them.</p>

<h2 id="later">Later</h2>

<p>When I launched my blog, I decided that I needed a project to get me posting about status updates, in posts that evolved into my Monday-morning <a href="https://john.colagioia.net/blog/tag/devjournal/">developer diary</a> posts.  And since the original Bicker code had fallen ten years out of date, it seemed like a good idea to build a new version of that, after ten years more than the original &ldquo;basically no years&rdquo; of web development that I had the first time through.</p>

<p>You can see the progress at the time, both in the repository and in the early blog posts.  I didn&rsquo;t get to all the features that I wanted in the original, but I do have something there that functions, or at least <em>functioned</em>, last time that I checked.</p>

<h2 id="where-things-stand-today">Where Things Stand Today</h2>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll try to actually answer the question.</p>

<p>At the time that I worked on new version of Bicker, I&rsquo;d occasionally indicate that somebody could probably change the long-form comment to get something that a person could embed on a webpage, sort of like <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>.  Or it could maybe serve as a primitive kind of social media, with the work put in to add modern moderation tools.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t do either of those, because those both felt like &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; projects that I&rsquo;d need to support&mdash;of the technical, rather than emotional, sort&mdash;and actually run it somewhere that it&rsquo;d stay consistently available with backups in case anything went wrong.  The former requires that I stay available &ldquo;in case&rdquo; somebody needs help, and the latter involves spending far more time on deployment (or DevOps, these days, I guess) than I really want to bother with, at least without that producing enough income to warrant it.</p>

<p>As a result, Bicker sort of sits waiting for someone to either find it interesting enough to advance it or get me interested enough in the work to prioritize it over more entertaining options.  That sounds flippant, but I do mean that in the sense that it probably wouldn&rsquo;t take much to push me back in that direction if I saw the need.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With people learning about RSS, I want to mention something that you&rsquo;ll probably all want to know, if you haven&rsquo;t found it yet.</p>

<p>Unless &ldquo;some guy&rdquo; wrote it in an afternoon, every RSS reader can export and import <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">Outline Processor Markup Language</a>, which lets you move your set of RSS feeds around.  Do you not like your reader?  Export OPML and import it into a different reader.  Want to share your collection with people?  Hand out the file&hellip;as long as you don&rsquo;t have any feeds that require a password.</p>

<p>Advanced Stuff:  You can also hand-edit the OPML file, too, if you take some care with the XML so that you don&rsquo;t leave rogue opening or closing tags.  If you don&rsquo;t know what that means, then you probably don&rsquo;t want to do it.  But if you <em>do</em> know what that means, then this lets you share what you read with somebody without worrying about that one feed that embarrasses you.</p>

<p>Most podcast applications do something similar, by the way, but I don&rsquo;t want to muddy the topic.</p>

<p>On a whim, I did some informal research, and came out with something to maybe consider, when people talk about how Cohost didn&rsquo;t have a chance, because it didn&rsquo;t mistreat us or whatever other fatalistic nonsense people feel like spreading.</p>

<p>Cohost already existed for a couple of months when &ldquo;Twitter replacements&rdquo; Pebble (originally T2) and Post.News launched in November 2022.  T2/Pebble shut down about a year ago.  Post.News shut down about five months ago; either or both became an unofficial Mastodon instance.</p>

<p>Both had larger staffs paid out of VC investment, and shut down because they didn&rsquo;t see exponential user growth, which I take as an admission that they planned to shove ads and surveillance down everybody&rsquo;s throat.</p>

<p>Think that through:  On a much lower budget, with a much smaller staff, Cohost out-lasted its best-known contemporaries<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7726028:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by almost 100%, closing (largely) because regulation has made taking payments for (partially) adult content - their planned core business model, remember - a nightmare, rather than because they couldn&rsquo;t gather a large enough group of marks.</p>

<p>If Cohost couldn&rsquo;t succeed because &ldquo;the market,&rdquo; then how did it significantly outlast the two from people looking to replicate the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; Twitter experience with people experienced in delivering that&hellip;?</p>

      <p>Chris Bouzy&rsquo;s Spoutible launched a bit later than everyone else, and still kicks around, though I suspect that has a lot more to do with it serving as a showcase for his &ldquo;Bot Sentinel&rdquo; product than anything else and apparently only uses cheap freelance staff, though their design does notably center user safety. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>Regardless, my point is that this didn&rsquo;t happen in some alternative universe or as some scenario that retroactively overwrites the timeline.  You didn&rsquo;t dream it, nor did we pull you into some strange simulacrum of reality.  Everybody here really exists, living only physical distance from your parents&rsquo; house, at least those of us who still <em>do</em> live, large though you may find that distance.  You can go settle back in at home, and think about the rest of your life.  And you can keep in touch with your new friends&hellip;</p>

<p>While I didn&rsquo;t write this about or for the closure, though I may have accidentally summed up some of my feelings at the end.</p>

<p>I planned to write something like this a while ago, probably when a bunch of people seemed mired in more existential distress than usual, and then decided it felt hacky.  However, with people scattering and wondering what to do next, I wanted to share some musical bits from old children&rsquo;s television that have stuck with me for a few decades.  Ironically, given where this goes, I feel hesitant to post it, so I&rsquo;ll do that now before I re-edit into oblivion.</p>

<p>First, any time somebody acts like they need to prove themselves to me, I can only hear Fred Rogers singing <em>It&rsquo;s You I Like</em>.  I&rsquo;ve had close colleagues who worried about disappointing me, and half-wonder how quickly I&rsquo;d get fired if I sang to them.  Outside that context, I feel like more people need to listen to the song on repeat, because people like you for you, not what you do or how you present yourself.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mcq5oW0GvD8?si=z3eUBOKyevrJm1Ub" title="It's You I Like" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Also, Rogers and John Costa pumped out a lot of <em>decent</em> music for the show, but this has to sit near the top of the genre, right?</p>

<p>Next, do you not think that you can write <em>entire blog posts</em> without a social media site surrounding you?  Take it from somebody staring down a fifth anniversary blogging, they&rsquo;ll let <strong>any</strong> nitwit post things.  In this case, Joe Raposo tells you in <em>Sing</em>, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry if it&rsquo;s not good enough for anyone else to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QxOft5QZjDI?si=GQacYdwc8rXDKH7h" title="Sing/Canta" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Or as British developer Stuart Langridge once put it on his blog&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don&rsquo;t be creative. Be a creator. No one ever looks back and wishes that they&rsquo;d given the world less stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same vein, <strong>The Muppet Show</strong> had <em>Just One Person</em>, to make the point that &ldquo;maybe even you can believe in you, too.&rdquo;  OK, sure, they produced <strong>The Muppet Show</strong> for an audience of adults, but I watched it as a child (no comment about how old and whether I saw it in its first run&hellip;), so it qualifies for me.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ipe14_yCL_g?si=WioxYyJFBHRMjCd0" title="Just One Person" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Anyway, don&rsquo;t make me belabor the point:  People like you for you, and never worry about publishing bad things.  You can always go back and improve things, but you can&rsquo;t go back and get things out sooner.</p>

<p>If you ever wonder what rattles around in my head, this sort of thing accounts for most of the synapses, or if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered what they mean by &ldquo;the confidence of a mediocre white man&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>All right, enough with vaguely avuncular support.</p>

<p>Did I pull that together as a pretext for a final post?  Maybe&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="future-on-my-blogs">Future On-My-Blogs</h2>

<p>Digression:  Since posting here won&rsquo;t work to get the word out, I&rsquo;ll give some highlights of what I have coming up on my blog (that I&rsquo;ve already written).</p>

<ul>
  <li>This Thursday, building continuity from France Nguyen&rsquo;s Elaan of Troyius to Famke Janssen&rsquo;s Kamala to the Daxes (Daxen?) on <strong>DS9</strong>.  Also, bad archaeology, worse tables, and &ldquo;this wedding could have been an e-mail.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Soon (I wanted yesterday, but didn&rsquo;t pull it together in time), a run-through on getting the Fediverse (which for most people will mean Mastodon) to behave better.  If you have specific questions not related to mobile apps (for which my answer doesn&rsquo;t stray far from &ldquo;keep social media off your phone&rdquo;), drop me a line, and I&rsquo;ll see what I can scrounge up.</li>
  <li>The first few chapters of a Free Culture fantasy novel that might set a record for conveying information without explicit exposition.</li>
  <li>The Mummenschanz infestation aboard the <em>Enterprise</em>, the plan for genocide, and the subsequent plan for mercy&hellip;that they hope will accidentally end in genocide.</li>
  <li>Multiple levels of Mark Twain-ing <em>Star Trek</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I should also finally have <strong>The Light&rsquo;s Edge</strong> (an open science fiction universe that adapts Free Culture material inspired by certain non-free franchises) publishing soon, possibly starting with a half-joking equivalent to the &ldquo;tonight on&hellip;&rdquo; teaser from old TV shows.  I&rsquo;ll announce the first pieces on the blog as I serialize it.</p>

<p>If I can figure out how to find all the comments that I posted, maybe I&rsquo;ll recondition some of those into posts, too.  Any idea how one would do that&hellip;?</p>

<h2 id="endings">Endings</h2>

<p>Anyway the second time, having gone through a bunch of endings in my time, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve learned.</p>

<p>First, people make the place.  If you miss a place, you miss the people there, and you want to always acknowledge that.</p>

<p>But first-and-a-half, the place also makes the people, in that the choice of rules for participation and how the space enforces the rules determines who sticks around and how they act.  No matter where you spend your time, you want to think about that process and maybe ask other people if they see anything about that process that you don&rsquo;t, because none of us has a complete view.  And if a place doesn&rsquo;t <em>realize</em> that, you&rsquo;ll eventually have a bad time, there.</p>

<p>Second, losing a place or a person from the place almost always feels sad.  Either you enjoyed the relationship(s) or you wonder what took so long.</p>

<p>Third, we now live in a connected world.  As a teenager, by contrast, I moved not all that far away, and completely lost contact with everybody in my life not in my immediate family, only getting back in touch with some of them after decades.  Plan how you&rsquo;ll stay in contact with the people who you care about if your current context vanishes.  Everyplace will eventually vanish, and few places give it the consideration that @staff has to make that transition easier.  Honestly, most places would rather you not stay in contact at all, so put in the work ahead of time.</p>

<p>Finally, others have said this in more depth and more eloquently, but appreciate people in context.  I have as hard a time of this as anyone, as evidenced by my often leaving loosely related stories as comments like a cat leaving a decapitated mouse out of respect for your effort, but especially as people scatter and wander away from social media, we all need to stop relying on the crutch of &ldquo;I clicked like,&rdquo; because&hellip;that doesn&rsquo;t exist outside social media.  Especially when people move to blogs, I say as someone who writes one and so knows, find something to comment on, because a lot of people will assume that the lack of interaction means that they haven&rsquo;t found their audience.</p>

<p>Formerly a footnote that apparently won&rsquo;t foot:  I don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;comment on blogs&rdquo; to guilt people into commenting on <em>my</em> blog.  I definitely love it when people do comment and appreciate everybody&rsquo;s insight, but I mean it more as a tool for encouraging people getting started.  I now have enough momentum built up that I&rsquo;ll probably keep posting for at least six months after my death out of habit alone&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="otherwise">Otherwise</h2>

<p>Good luck, (try to) keep in touch, make the next spaces (even those that already exist) better than you found them, and never silence yourself because your idea seems too weird.  I assure you that <em>somebody</em> will appreciate your &ldquo;cock fights, but they angrily play baccarat instead of hurting each other&rdquo; idea will find its audience.</p>

<p>If anybody wants to find me, I&rsquo;ve updated all my contact information in my profile (and so it&rsquo;ll appear in the Find Your Friends bit of the export), <em>and</em> I have a pinned post about it, <em>and</em> you can find almost all the same information on my website.  Have no fears about reaching out.  It might take me a while to get back to you, but especially if you remind me that I know you, it probably won&rsquo;t go too badly.  Especially if you take a chat-based route, though, expect me to treat it as asynchronously as I would e-mail or social media&hellip;</p>

<p>You can <strong>not</strong> find me on Threads or Bluesky, both because they seem to utterly miss the point of people leaving Twitter <em>and</em> because (at least when I checked) they required a mobile app to sign up, to which I believe I specifically said &ldquo;ha ha, no.&rdquo;  If they changed those policies, maybe somebody can convince me to bump over to at least announce blog posts for the RSS-impaired.</p>

<p>‘Til we meet again&hellip;which honestly sounds like tomorrow morning, since I generally check in before the predicted shut-down time, but I (probably) won&rsquo;t post anything new then.  Oh, I meant for that sentence to end &ldquo;stay safe,&rdquo; but the digression preempted it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Interpret that how you will&hellip;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll meet again.  Or we&rsquo;ll meet other people who we confuse with each other and meh, close enough, at least it provides closure when we realize that these other people seem more annoying.  Or we&rsquo;ll all starve while watching the horizon waiting for the series of explosions that finally turn off the servers, and the trauma convinces us to finally get to know our neighbors and abandon anything with a transistor in it.</p>
